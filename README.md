# mpv-scripts
This is a collection of my own mpv scripts.

## boss-key.lua

### Requirements:
  - `xdotool` for Linux users

If you press `b`, the screen instantly pauses and minimises. Called like that
because you'd want to hide whatever you're watching when your boss (or mom)
walks in.

Thanks to [@zaza42](https://github.com/zaza42) for his Linux implementation.

## skiptosilence.lua

This script skips to the next silence in the file. The
intended use for this is to skip until the end of an
opening or ending sequence, at which point there's often a short
period of silence.

The default keybind is `F3`. You can change this by adding
the following line to your `input.conf`:
```
KEY script-binding skip-to-silence
```

In order to tweak the script parameters, you can place the
text below in a new file at
`script-opts/skiptosilence.conf` in mpv's user folder. The
parameters will be automatically loaded on start.

```
# Maximum amount of noise to trigger, in terms of dB.
# The default is -30 (yes, negative). -60 is very sensitive,
# -10 is more tolerant to noise.
quietness = -30

# Minimum duration of silence to trigger.
duration = 0.1

# The fast-forwarded audio can sound jarring. Set to 'yes'
# to mute it while skipping.
mutewhileskipping = no
```

## histogram.lua (updated 2020-01-27)

This script exposes a configurable way to overlay ffmpeg histograms in mpv.  
There is a substantial amount of config available, but this script does *not* support config files, because of the nested options. Please edit the options in the `opts` array in the script itself.  

There are three default keybinds:
 - `h`: Toggle the histogram on/off
 - `H` (`Shift+h`): Cycle between the pixel formats available
 - `Alt+h`: Toggle between linear and logarithmic levels

These keybinds can be changed by placing the following lines
in your `input.conf`:
```
KEY script-binding toggle-histogram
KEY script-binding cycle-histogram-pixel-format
KEY script-binding cycle-histogram-levels-mode
```

The histogram video filter will likely not work, if hardware decoding is used. Therefore, if hardware decoding is detected, it is disabled when the histogram is toggled on and the setting is restored when toggled off.
